In Kotlin, the double colon :: is used for several purposes, depending on the context.
 Here are the main uses of the double colon in Kotlin:

1)Method Reference: When used before a function or method name,
-it creates a reference to that function without invoking it.
 -This is particularly useful when you want to pass a function as an argument or assign
 it to a variable without actually calling the function. For example:

Example:

fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}
 val operation: (Int, Int) -> Int = ::add

Here, ::add creates a reference to the add function, and operation becomes a variable that holds this reference.


2)Constructor Reference: You can also use :: to refer to a constructor of a class.
-This is useful when you want to create instances of a class without actually invoking the constructor.
For example:

class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

val personConstructor: (String, Int) -> Person = ::Person

In this example, ::Person refers to the constructor of the Person class.

3)Reference to a Property or Member: You can use :: to refer to properties or members of a class.
-This is often used when you want to access properties or members in reflection-related tasks.
 For example:

class MyClass {
    val myProperty: Int = 42
}
val propertyReference: KProperty<Int> = MyClass::myProperty

In this case, MyClass::myProperty refers to the myProperty property of the MyClass class.

4)Member Function Reference: You can use :: to refer to a member function of a class as well.
 -This is used in cases similar to method references but with class instances. For example:

fun Int.isEven(): Boolean = this % 2 == 0

val checkEven: (Int) -> Boolean = Int::isEven
Here, Int::isEven refers to the isEven member function of the Int class.

In summary, :: is a versatile operator in Kotlin that can be used to refer to functions,
 constructors, properties, and member functions, depending on the context.
  It's a powerful tool that aids in functional programming, reflection, and other advanced programming techniques.
