What is data Class?
=>In simple terms, a data class in Kotlin is a special type of class designed to hold data.
 It's a way to define a class where the primary purpose is to store properties and their values.
 Kotlin provides some additional functionality for data classes, such as automatically generating
  useful methods like toString(), equals(), hashCode(), and more.

 => Think of a data class as a convenient way to create objects that represent some specific data
  or entity in your program. It saves you from writing a lot of repetitive code for properties,
   constructors, and common methods.

   Syntax:

   For example, let's say you have a class that represents a simple user profile with a name and an age:

  =>  data class UserProfile(val name: String, val age: Int)


  Running the code:
  fun main() {
      val user1 = UserProfile("Alice", 25)
      val user2 = UserProfile("Bob", 30)

      println(user1) // Output: UserProfile(name=Alice, age=25)
      println(user1 == user2) // Output: false
  }
