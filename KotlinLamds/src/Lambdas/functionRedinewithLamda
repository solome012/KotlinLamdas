Redefine the function with a lambda expression
Lambda expressions provide a concise syntax to define a function without the fun keyword.
You can store a lambda expression directly in a variable without a function reference on another function.

Before the assignment operator (=), you add the val or var keyword followed by the name
of the variable, which is what you use when you call the function. After the assignment
operator (=) is the lambda expression, which consists of a pair of curly braces that
form the function body. The syntax is illustrated in this syntax:

val variable name = {
// function body
}
