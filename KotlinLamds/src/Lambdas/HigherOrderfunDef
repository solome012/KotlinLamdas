n Kotlin, higher-order functions are functions that can take one or more functions as parameters
 and/or return a function. This concept is a fundamental part of functional programming and provides
  a powerful way to abstract and manipulate behavior in your code. Higher-order functions allow you
  to treat functions as first-class citizens, just like any other values, such as integers or strings.

Here's a breakdown of the components involved in higher-order functions:

1)Function Types: In Kotlin, functions have types just like any other values. For example,
the type of a function that takes an integer and returns an integer can be represented
 as (Int) -> Int. Similarly, a function that takes no parameters and returns a string has a type of () -> String.

2)Passing Functions as Parameters: Higher-order functions can accept other functions
as parameters. This enables you to provide custom behavior to the higher-order function.


Here's a simple example:
example1:
fun applyOperation(x: Int, operation: (Int) -> Int): Int {
    return operation(x)
}

fun main() {
    val result = applyOperation(5) { num -> num * 2 }
    println(result) // Output: 10
}

In this example, the applyOperation function takes an integer x and a function operation,
and it applies the provided function to the integer.

Example2:

Returning Functions: Higher-order functions can also return functions as their results.
 This allows you to generate functions on the fly based on certain conditions or inputs. Here's an example:

fun createMultiplier(factor: Int): (Int) -> Int {
    return { num -> num * factor }
}

fun main() {
    val timesTwo = createMultiplier(2)
    val result = timesTwo(7) // Applying the returned function
    println(result) // Output: 14
}

In this case, the createMultiplier function returns a new function
 that multiplies its argument by the given factor.
